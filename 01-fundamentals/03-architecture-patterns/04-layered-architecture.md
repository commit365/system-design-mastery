# 04. Layered Architecture

## Overview

Layered architecture is a widely used architectural pattern in software design that organizes an application into distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities. This approach promotes separation of concerns, making the system easier to manage, develop, and maintain. In this lesson, we will explore the characteristics of layered architecture, its advantages and disadvantages, and scenarios in which it is most appropriate.

## What is Layered Architecture?

**Definition**: Layered architecture is an architectural pattern that structures an application into multiple layers, where each layer has a specific role and communicates with adjacent layers. The most common layers include the presentation layer, business logic layer, data access layer, and sometimes a service layer.

### Common Layers in Layered Architecture

1. **Presentation Layer**: This is the topmost layer responsible for handling user interactions. It presents data to the user and collects user input. This layer typically includes user interface components such as web pages, mobile app screens, or desktop application forms.

2. **Business Logic Layer (BLL)**: Also known as the domain layer, this layer contains the core functionality of the application. It processes user input, applies business rules, and coordinates data flow between the presentation and data access layers.

3. **Data Access Layer (DAL)**: This layer is responsible for interacting with the data storage systems, such as databases or external APIs. It abstracts the underlying data access technologies and provides a consistent interface for the business logic layer to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

4. **Service Layer** (optional): In some architectures, a service layer is introduced to encapsulate business logic and expose it through APIs. This layer can facilitate communication between different applications or services, promoting reusability and modularity.

### Layer Interaction

In a layered architecture, each layer communicates only with the layers directly adjacent to it. For example, the presentation layer interacts with the business logic layer, while the business logic layer interacts with the data access layer. This separation helps to isolate changes and reduces dependencies between layers.

## Advantages of Layered Architecture

1. **Separation of Concerns**: By organizing the application into distinct layers, each layer can focus on a specific aspect of the application. This separation simplifies development, testing, and maintenance.

2. **Modularity**: Each layer can be developed and tested independently, allowing teams to work on different layers simultaneously. This modularity promotes code reuse and simplifies integration.

3. **Ease of Maintenance**: Changes in one layer typically do not affect other layers, making it easier to implement updates and enhancements. For example, changes to the user interface can be made without impacting the business logic or data access layers.

4. **Improved Testability**: Layered architecture facilitates unit testing and integration testing by allowing developers to test individual layers in isolation. This leads to better code quality and fewer bugs.

5. **Flexibility**: The architecture allows for flexibility in technology choices. For instance, different data access technologies can be used in the DAL without affecting the business logic layer.

## Disadvantages of Layered Architecture

1. **Performance Overhead**: The additional layers can introduce performance overhead due to the increased number of calls between layers. This can lead to latency, especially if not managed properly.

2. **Complexity in Simple Applications**: For small applications, implementing a layered architecture may introduce unnecessary complexity. In such cases, a simpler architecture may be more appropriate.

3. **Tight Coupling Between Layers**: While layered architecture promotes separation of concerns, it can also lead to tight coupling between layers if not designed carefully. Changes in one layer may necessitate changes in adjacent layers.

4. **Difficulty in Layer Independence**: As applications grow, maintaining true independence between layers can become challenging. Dependencies can creep in, leading to a less flexible architecture.

## When to Use Layered Architecture

Layered architecture is best suited for specific scenarios, including:

1. **Enterprise Applications**: For large-scale enterprise applications that require clear separation of concerns and modularity, layered architecture provides a robust framework for development.

2. **Applications with Complex Business Logic**: When an application has intricate business rules and processes, organizing the logic into a dedicated business logic layer can simplify management and maintenance.

3. **Applications Requiring Scalability**: Layered architecture allows for independent scaling of different layers, which can be beneficial as the application grows and user demand increases.

4. **Long-Lived Applications**: For applications that are expected to evolve over time, layered architecture supports easier updates and enhancements, leading to better long-term maintainability.

5. **Team Collaboration**: In environments with multiple development teams, layered architecture allows teams to work on different layers concurrently, improving collaboration and productivity.

## Conclusion

Layered architecture is a powerful architectural pattern that promotes separation of concerns, modularity, and maintainability in software design. By understanding its characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages, developers can effectively apply this architecture in scenarios where it provides the most value. This approach is particularly well-suited for enterprise applications and systems with complex business logic.
